# Weather App

### Tues 9 August 2022

Odin again. This time APIs and Async/Await.

Also using modules and webpack for the experience.

Getting base functionality sorted first.

### Update (Weds 10 Aug 2022)

Most of this done. I managed to get 90% of this up and running in an hour or so yesterday, with ZERO assistance needed from Google – a clear sign of progress for me.

Bit of trouble aligning the async function last night, but I found a solution. I called the second one from within the first (I had been calling them separately and of course there was a conflict.) Probably not the optimal solution but the program works and doesn't break.

A few things left to do – I have completed the tasks set within ODIN itself, so these are almost entirely optional:

-   add search functionality from input field
-   add 'loading' component for time taken to complete call to APIs
-   improve styling for web and mobile (probably the only thing to focus on, as I have barely bothered with any styling)
